# Instructions

![referencia](https://github.com/Alextor121/Compresor_imagenes_walfu/blob/main/Executable/instrucciones.png?raw=true)

1. Select the folder where your **.jpg** images (the program is designed to process batched images but will work for jus one).
2. Select the folder where you want your **compressed** images to be stored.
3. Set how much of the original resolution you want to keep (less value means that you get a smaller photo) (the value that has better worked for me to mantain good quality is 60%).
4. Set the compression of the output (bigger value means a heavier compression) (the value that has better worked for me is around 40%).
5. Execute the program. It will compress all **.jpg** images in the origin folder.
